Requirements
============

``django-axes`` requires a supported Django version. The application is
intended to work around the Django admin and the regular
``django.contrib.auth`` login-powered pages.
Look here https://github.com/jazzband/django-axes/blob/master/.travis.yml
to check if your django / python version are supported.
